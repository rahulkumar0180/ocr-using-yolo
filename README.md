# OCR using YOLO

This project implements Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect various objects, including text, in images.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how YOLO can be used for detecting and extracting text from images. The OCR process involves detecting text regions in an image using YOLO and then using optical character recognition techniques to extract the text from those regions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/rahulkumar0180/ocr-using-yolo.git`

2. Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

1. Prepare your image(s) containing text.

2. Run the OCR script:
`python ocr_using_yolo.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg`


3. View the output. The detected text will be printed to the console.
